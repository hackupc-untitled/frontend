**GNSS Data Visualization App**

Welcome to our GNSS Data Visualization App, built as a solution for the Hackathon UPC challenge defined by the European Space Agency (ESA). Our application aims to provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface to visualize data provided by the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) library. The backend is powered by Flask, while the frontend is developed using Flutter.
